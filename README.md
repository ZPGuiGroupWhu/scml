# scML: scalable manifold learning by uniform landmark sampling and constrained locally linear embedding
We propose a scalable manifold learning (scML) method that can cope with large-scale and high-dimensional data in an efficient manner. It starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton of the entire data, and then incorporates the non-landmarks into this skeleton based on the constrained locally linear embedding.
